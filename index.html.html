            <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Biking, also known as cycling, is a popular activity enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. It involves riding bicycles, which are human-powered vehicles with two wheels attached to a frame, propelled by pedaling. Biking can be done for various purposes, including recreation, exercise, commuting, or competitive sports.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Recreation: </strong>Many people enjoy biking simply for the pleasure of riding. Whether it's exploring scenic trails, cruising through urban streets, or touring countryside roads, biking offers a sense of freedom and adventure Biking is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise that can improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and endurance.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Exercise:</strong>Biking is an eco-friendly and cost-effective mode of transportation for commuting to work, school, or running errands. It helps reduce traffic congestion and air pollution while providing a convenient way to travel short to moderate distances.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Commuting: </strong>Cycling includes various competitive disciplines such as road racing, mountain biking, BMX, track cycling, and cyclocross. Athletes compete in races or events ranging from local competitions to international championships like the Tour de France or the Olympics
            <br> <br>
             <strong>Social Interaction:</strong>Biking can also be a social activity, allowing people to ride together in groups, clubs, or organized events. Group rides provide opportunities for camaraderie, networking, and shared experiences.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Health Benefits: </strong>In addition to cardiovascular benefits, biking can help improve mental well-being by reducing stress, boosting mood, and enhancing cognitive function. It's also a sustainable form of transportation that promotes environmental conservation.

            <h2 class="desc">PARA_GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves flying through the air using a fabric wing (paraglider) and harness. It's a form of recreational and competitive flying that offers participants the thrill of soaring like a bird and experiencing breathtaking aerial views.
            <br>
            Here's how paragliding typically works:
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Paraglider:</strong> A paraglider is a lightweight, non-motorized, inflatable wing made of ripstop nylon fabric. It has several rows of interconnected air cells that fill with air as the pilot runs forward to launch. The shape of the wing and the airflow over it create lift, allowing the pilot to stay aloft.
            <br>
            <strong>Harness:</strong> The pilot is suspended beneath the paraglider in a harness, which is connected to the wing by sturdy lines. The harness provides support and control, allowing the pilot to steer and maneuver the paraglider during flight.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Launch:</strong> Paragliders typically launch from elevated sites such as hillsides, mountains, or specially designated launch areas. The pilot inflates the wing by pulling on the risers (lines attached to the leading edge of the wing) while running forward. As the wing fills with air and generates lift, the pilot becomes airborne.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Flight:</strong> Once airborne, the pilot can control the direction and speed of the paraglider by shifting their weight and manipulating the brake toggles attached to the trailing edge of the wing. By pulling on the brakes asymmetrically, the pilot can turn left or right. By applying both brakes simultaneously, the pilot can slow down or descend.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Landing:</strong> Paragliders typically land at designated landing zones, which may be located at the base of the launch site or in nearby open areas. The pilot uses a combination of steering inputs and flare technique (pulling down both brake toggles) to control the descent and land safely.

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a water sport where participants, known as surfers, ride waves on a surfboard towards the shore. It's considered both a recreational activity and a competitive sport, with roots tracing back centuries, particularly in Polynesian culture. 
            <br> <br>
            Here's an overview of how surfing typically works:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Equipment:</strong> Surfers use specialized equipment, including a surfboard and sometimes additional gear such as a wetsuit and leash. Surfboards come in various shapes and sizes, with different designs suited for specific wave conditions and surfing styles.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Waves:</strong> Surfing requires waves, which are created by the wind's energy transferring to the water's surface. Surfers seek out locations with suitable wave conditions, such as beaches, points, reefs, or breaks, where waves break consistently and provide opportunities for riding.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Catching Waves:</strong> Once positioned in the lineup, surfers scan the ocean for incoming waves and choose which ones to catch. To catch a wave, surfers paddle toward shore as the wave approaches, timing their entry to match the wave's speed and angle.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Riding the Wave:</strong> As the wave lifts the surfboard and begins to break, the surfer quickly transitions from paddling to a standing position, using balance and body positioning to ride along the face of the wave. Surfers can perform various maneuvers such as carving turns, bottom turns, cutbacks, and aerials, depending on their skill level and the wave's characteristics.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Exiting the Wave:</strong> After riding the wave, surfers typically maneuver to either side or the wave's shoulder, where the wave loses energy and eventually dissipates. They then paddle back out to the lineup to catch more waves or return to shore.
